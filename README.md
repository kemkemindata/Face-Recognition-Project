## Face Detection using Viola-Jones Algorithm
## INTRODUCTION
This project is a Face Detection App built using OpenCV and Streamlit. 
It leverages the Viola-Jones face detection algorithm to detect faces from a camera feed and draw rectangles around them. 
Users can interact with the app, adjust detection parameters, and save images of detected faces.
